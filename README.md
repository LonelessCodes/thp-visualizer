# THP Visualizer

I was sick of using After Effects for simple audio visualizations like this. It would usually take up to a second or two for a single frame to render and it simply does not scale on one to two hour videos. So why not use the power of real-time graphics in WebGL. Then I just capture the HDMI signal from the screen, and done.

I went for WebGL, because it's got this easy to setup codebase and it just runs, no matter what device.
Other branches of this repo might include visualizations written in Processing though.
